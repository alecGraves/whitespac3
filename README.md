# whitespac3
A python object to help people code in whitespace.

I created this because it would be funny to win complicated competitions on HackerRank using whitepace.

This repo also includes a whitespace interpreter so you can test your code locally.

Everything is using python3, and I do not know if it will still work in other versions.

## Usage:
There is an example file that I use while I work on the object called test.py

This will 'compile' the code in test.py into whitespace code:

    python3 test.py

I used system out to automatically run the generated whitespace code after it is 'compiled' in test.py

This can be used to run whitespace code seperately:

    python3 interpreter.py output.ws
    
## Future:
I am still working on stuff. Recently, I added comparisons, basic loops, and other stuff. 

It is kind of messy right now, but I should be able to work on it more now that finals week is over.

Hopefully someone else finds this amusing and wins some awards on HackerRank using whitespace.
